# Overview

With this project I aim to learn how to use Java to mod minecraft.

This will help me to learn how to work with established codebases, and implement changes to them.

# Development Environment

I used InteliJ IDEA as the IDE for writing this software.

I used Oracles open source Java-20 SDK.

I used Minecraft Forge to mod the game files.
